# diffusion-xray
experiments and utilities to reverse engineer diffusion model mechanics and its neural networks.

## Experiments
all experiments are scripts that start with test* or text* filename. They each decompose the building blocks of a diffuction model and test its characterictics in isolation.

## Tools
tensor_debug module contains a DebugTensor class that makes easy to reverse engineer an encoded vector.
